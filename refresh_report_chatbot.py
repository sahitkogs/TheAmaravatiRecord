"""Strip old chatbot from report HTML files and re-inject with current library.

The report files (lps-caste-dashboard.html, lps-caste-investigation.html) have
an old version of the chatbot baked in with hardcoded cyan colors, old model
lists, and missing features. This script strips the old chatbot CSS/HTML/JS
and re-injects using the current chatbot-in-html library with the newspaper theme.

Usage:
    python refresh_report_chatbot.py
